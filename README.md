# SHREK
An Experimental Bit Serial Architecture

Bit Serial Computers have been around for 80 years - but nobody seemed to notice.

Born out of 1940's wartime electronics, bit serial architectures would dominate the early days of mainframes and desk top calculators.

Despised as being "slow" they are an excellent architecture for teaching digital design.

In 1948, the Cambridge University EDSAC achieved 600 instructions per second. The "SHREK" will do at least 50,000 instructions per second, on a small circuit board costing $30.

Buckle up and enjoy the ride....
